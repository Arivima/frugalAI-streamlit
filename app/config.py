Climate change is NOT leading to melting ice (such as glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost), increased extreme weather, or rising sea levels. Cold weather also shows that climate change is not happening",

        "4": "This category gathers claims against climate solutions - Climate solutions are harmful or unnecessary",
        "5": "This category gathers claims questioning climate science validity - Climate science is uncertain, unsound, unreliable, or biased.",
        "6": "This category gathers claims attacking climate scientists and activists - Climate scientists and proponents of climate action are alarmist, biased, wrong, hypocritical, corrupt, and/or politically motivated.",
        "7": "This category gathers claims promoting fossil fuel necessity - We need fossil fuels for economic growth, prosperity, and to maintain our standard of living.",
